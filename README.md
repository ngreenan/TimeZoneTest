# TimeZoneTest
An Android app for working out when people in different time zones are available

Current version is very much a proof of concept/work in progress, but it gives you an idea of what it might look like eventually!

[Version 1 - got the rings in place](http://i.imgur.com/QqEEsuf.png)

[Version 2 - got the clock numbers in, arrow at top and auto rotate so now is at top](http://i.imgur.com/bKClV69.png)

[Version 3 - we can now set the time! also changed my time and their time from being portions of the ring to arcs overlapping the ring](http://i.imgur.com/ZvVb0Fd.png)
